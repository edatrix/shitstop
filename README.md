# shitstop

while visiting a local attraction with my husband and dad, i asked my husband to take our son to the bathroom and change his diaper.  he took him, but quickly returned, telling me that there was no changing table in the men's restroom.  i looked at the door of the women's and saw a sticker idicating the presence of a changing table, then took our son in and changed his diaper.
