while visiting a local attraction with my husband and dad, my husband Chris took our son, Jude, to the bathroom to change his diaper.  the two came back just a minute later and Chris explained that he couldn't change Jude's diaper because there was no changing station in the men's restroom.  i looked to the door of the women's, saw a sticker indicating the presence of a changing table there, then took Jude in and changed his diaper.

this is not the first time Chris and i have found ourselves in this situation, and annoying as it is, it's not even the worst.  recently, as we were driving home to Colorado from Iowa, we stopped at a fast food restaurant for a quick bite and diaper change.  here, we were confronted with the situation where there was no changing station in either restroom, so we changed our kid on a bench seat an a Taco Bell in The Middle of Nowhere, Nebraska.  sorry not sorry.

so i'm starting this list.  i know this README has a lot of actual words, but help me add places.  i mean, it's 2015.  why shouldn't dads have a clean place to change their kids' diapers?  and do people in Nebraska just not change their babies?  and if an establishment is visited often enough to provide (or be required to provide) a public restroom, shouldn't they also have a place for both men and women to change their kids' diapers?

i'm not sure what i'm going to do with this thing, but i hope that:

* this list will grow enough to help people find a place they can change their kids
* businesses on the list that don't have a chean space for diaper changing that is accessible to both women and men will wise up and add some
* Chris will somehow map this in a way that makes sense ;)
